        <h2>Technical information</h2>
        <p>
          This web app lets you create, read, update and delete personal work
          experiences. The frontend communicates with a backend server through
          an API to perform these CRUD operations. The server uses a SQlite
          database for persistance.
        </p>
        <h2>What I've learned</h2>
        <p>
          The main thing I learned was how to handle HTTP responses via the
          Fetch API in a more thoughtful and reliable way. I used to just fetch
          data, assume it would always be there, and wrap it in a try/catch out
          of formality. I didn't really care. I just logged any errors that
          occurred and let the app explode. But now my mindset shifted from not
          caring, to actually thinking about what could go wrong and how to
          handle errors without breaking the app.
        </p>
        <p>I do this by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sending meaningful, structured response errors from the backend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handling errors gracefully so the app doesn't crash unexpectedly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping both the user and the developer informed when something goes
            wrong.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This ensures the app works not just when everything's fine, but also
          when the servers are down or something unexpected happens.
        </p>
        <p>This is my redemption arc.</p>
        <p>
          I also learned how to modularize my projects better by separating
          concerns between files and functions to build a cleaner, more
          maintainable codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't focus much on API communication itself, since I covered that
          in the previous assignment. But this time, I improved on it by using
          actual RESTful endpoints instead of routes like /insert or /delete.
